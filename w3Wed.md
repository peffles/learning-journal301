# Learning Journal Week 3:
## Recap;
This past week and a half has been all about back end and how your front end and your back end communictate.
I am really excited to be diving into back end development as well as APIs
My favorite thing that we have covered was really learnng the relationship between your front and back end and being able to get data from a database or an API and display that data back. As someone who wants to go into fullstack development I am very interested in learning more about the full stack.
Overall, i feel i am grasping the material quite well, I struggle a little bit when it comes to SQL but I feel I am strong elsewhere.

# Learning Journal Week 1: Monday
1. Today we got an intro into what we are going to be doing in the 301 course. Today was all about RWD or responsive web design and how RWD has

2. When you want to make a responsive website, you want to start with the mobile first. It is much easier to work your way out than to have a desktop website and work your way to mobile.
